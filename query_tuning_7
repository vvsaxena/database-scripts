Origial Query Was running 5+ hours in biggest client database eversafe
SELECT DISTINCT cn.*
                FROM customer_notes cn
                LEFT JOIN customers c
                    ON c.id = cn.customer_id
                LEFT JOIN tech_schedule ts_install
                    on c.install_appointment_id = ts_install.id
                LEFT JOIN tech_schedule ts
                    ON cn.tech_schedule_id = ts.id
                LEFT JOIN calendar_events ce
                    ON cn.id = ce.customer_note_id
                LEFT JOIN customer_communications cc
                    ON cc.customer_note_id = cn.id
                WHERE cn.id > 0
                     AND cn.user_id IN ('2481')
                ORDER BY cn.id DESC

Explain found that table "ce" ( calendar_events ) does not use index and show lots of rows scanned . So built index on
customer_note_id column on calendar_events table and same query was finished in 7 seconds. Huge gain.

alter table calendar_events add index idx_notes (customer_note_id);
